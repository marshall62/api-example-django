bugs:
if patient goes from exam back to waiting , the wait time isn't set correctly

duration is not set correctly when patient goes from waiting to session


-------------------

If patient checks in but then disappears, dr will mark as no-show.
They should probably stay in the waiting room list but marked as no-show.  That way if dr later
sees them in waiting room, they can be admitted.

If dr marks patient 'no show' and then patient checks in, need to repopulate in sched

Use constants in both back and front ends for statuses.

endpoint mocking

patient checkout will mark non-complete & checked-in appts as ''

overall-rating of satisfaction is done at checkout but shows on the doctors schedule in a table at the bottom
for completed appts with ratings.  Also an average daily rating in stats box.

complete appoints should be placed in some table of finished work so that we can show ratings on them
each time one gets rated at checkout

1.  Install latest version of all libs mentioned in requirements.txt
except must use Django 1.11.23
mysql-python has error remove from list.

run python manage.py migrate to create db tables.

2.  Since I'm not using docker the two strings created for oauth communication with API need to be grabbed from drchrono website
and set as environment vars with these names:
SOCIAL_AUTH_CLIENT_ID=abqHNtcyOZWxqFM9Cu1QyzFL8UoyjdrjpP0YXYnM
SOCIAL_AUTH_SECRET=3NYl6TcSnxlsxSG0nqJ3N5nPgeWR2fwW0r4V9J9j9fMpyxqSSwZtf4CfO5w1A102mNQlAPxknZIJw5eWMEcUy2qCbDT7XIKM2apFSTVc4OjD6mwCygI5jAZVTJHOeZk6

3.
I went to localhost:8080/setup and this takes me to drchron website login which I do.  From there I can then get to
a successful localhost:8080/welcome

So it's not that clear where they want me to plug in my work. There is a url path:
url(r'^welcome/$', views.DoctorWelcome.as_view(), name='setup'),

I think this might be the Page they mention in the instructions of the Kiosk to allow a Dr to login to the kiosk which brings the kiosk to
a page that allows patients to check in.

-Not sure what paths are supposed to be used for the doctor dashboard so I'm going to add new ones.
-Not sure where the appointments and patients arriving/checking in comes from.   Is db pre-loaded with some?
-Am I supposed to learn the drchrono API and start making calls to it to see whats in the db?

 Exploring this and I find no tables in the db relevant to appointments, patients, etc.  So I guess I build my own model for this and
 populate however I want.  So what am I using the API for?  Just login of doctor?



New Machine setup for PyCharm/Intellij
clone git repo
1. Create venv with IDE using python 3.5+ base interpreter
2. Goto project settings and set source dir as drchrono
3. Open any .py file so that popup comes up offering to install dependencies and accept installing
4. Drop down to venv shell and "python manage.py migrate" to get db set up
5. Create a run config called "run-server" with script of manage.py parameters:runserver 8080 and the two environment vars/vals below (for my user marshall62 running on localhost:8080)

        <env name="SOCIAL_AUTH_CLIENT_ID" value="abqHNtcyOZWxqFM9Cu1QyzFL8UoyjdrjpP0YXYnM" />
        <env name="SOCIAL_AUTH_SECRET" value="3NYl6TcSnxlsxSG0nqJ3N5nPgeWR2fwW0r4V9J9j9fMpyxqSSwZtf4CfO5w1A102mNQlAPxknZIJw5eWMEcUy2qCbDT7XIKM2apFSTVc4OjD6mwCygI5jAZVTJHOeZk6" />
6. Run the run-server config.
7. browse to http://localhost:8080/setup/ and login
