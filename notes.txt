1.  Install latest version of all libs mentioned in requirements.txt
except must use Django 1.11.23
mysql-python has error remove from list.

run python manage.py migrate to create db tables.

2.  Since I'm not using docker the two strings created for oauth communication with API need to be grabbed from drchrono website
and set as environment vars with these names:
SOCIAL_AUTH_CLIENT_ID=abqHNtcyOZWxqFM9Cu1QyzFL8UoyjdrjpP0YXYnM
SOCIAL_AUTH_SECRET=3NYl6TcSnxlsxSG0nqJ3N5nPgeWR2fwW0r4V9J9j9fMpyxqSSwZtf4CfO5w1A102mNQlAPxknZIJw5eWMEcUy2qCbDT7XIKM2apFSTVc4OjD6mwCygI5jAZVTJHOeZk6

3.
I went to localhost:8080/setup and this takes me to drchron website login which I do.  From there I can then get to
a successful localhost:8080/welcome

So it's not that clear where they want me to plug in my work. There is a url path:
url(r'^welcome/$', views.DoctorWelcome.as_view(), name='setup'),

I think this might be the Page they mention in the instructions of the Kiosk to allow a Dr to login to the kiosk which brings the kiosk to
a page that allows patients to check in.

-Not sure what paths are supposed to be used for the doctor dashboard so I'm going to add new ones.
-Not sure where the appointments and patients arriving/checking in comes from.   Is db pre-loaded with some?
-Am I supposed to learn the drchrono API and start making calls to it to see whats in the db?

 Exploring this and I find no tables in the db relevant to appointments, patients, etc.  So I guess I build my own model for this and
 populate however I want.  So what am I using the API for?  Just login of doctor?
